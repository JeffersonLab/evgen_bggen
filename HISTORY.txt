History of program bggen
Program bggen is actually from hall-d software package. The original introduction
of this program is in file README.HallD.
In 2015 Rakitha Beminiwattha extracted it out for moller and SoLID projects.
Check README.Rakitha for details about what he changed and how to compile|run it.
In April 2018, Jixie Zhang made modifications with Rakitha's version and created
version 1.0.0 and uploaded it to github. All the modifications are listed below.
For detail changes, please see file 'diff.txt'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0

1. Removed code/Makefile since it depends on Hall-D software.

2. Modified code/bg_hddm.c to disable HDDM related stuff.

3. Added Makefile which can compile this program in '-m64' mode.

4. Modified code/CMakeLists.txt to compile in '-m64' mode, the executable is linked
   against static library.
   
5. Added the following variables in input file:  
   beam current, target length, target density, target material.rad.length,
   and radiator thickness.
   From now on beam and target luminocity will be calculated using input parameters.
   Radiator thickness is used to control whether or not to use coherence bremsstrahlung
   or normal bremsstrahlung radiation.  If radiator thickness  > 1.0E-6 will 
   use coherence bremsstrahlung.
   
   The following files have been changed:
   code/bg_ctrl.inc
   code/bremsbeam_ini.F
   code/bg_ini.F
   code/cohbeam_ini.F
   code/cobrems.F

   These 3 cards were added in fort.15
C -- radiator thickness in cm, if >1.0E-6, will use coherence brem. photon
RADTHICK 0.00 
C -- electron beam current (uA)
CURRENT  15.0          
C -- Only Hydrogen target is supported, need more work for other target 
C -- tg length,density,material.rad.length. In cm, g/cm^3, g/cm^2.
TARGET  15.0   0.071   63.0470

6. Modified common block variable DCOLL (diameter of the radiator) to be in unit of cm.  
   Before it is in m, which is not consistant with other parameters in the same common block.
    
7. Changed bremsbeam_ini(xxx) and cohbeam_ini(xxx). Removed 'ZCOLLIM,COLDIAM'
   from argument list since they are inside common block.
    
8. Changed cobrems(xxx), add argument radThick.
    Subroutine cobrems(Emax,Epeak,colDist,colDiam,radThick)
    
9. Changed bremsbeam_ini(xxx). Added more comments. disable calling cobrems(xxx)
   since cobrems(xxx) only does initialization for coherence bremsstrahlung.
   It does nothing for normal bremsstrahlung radiation.    

10.Updated code/rnd_ini.F. If user given ZERO random seed in card 'RNDMSEQ', will
   use process ID and system time to form a seed, otherwise use the given see.
